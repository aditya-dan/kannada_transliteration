The aim of this project is to examine simple and intuitive ways of transliterating Kannada words from the Latin alphabet to the Kannada alphabet. Since personal computer keyboards in India typically have only the Latin letters labelled upon their keys, the usage of Kannada keyboard input methods often requires memorizing which key corresponds to which Kannada character. Keyboard input methods based on transliteration may be easier and more intuitive to use. The goal is to create something like this: namaskara -> ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ
